# AVM
This is a VM with a small 16 bit instruction set, an assembler and an assembly language that I wrote for fun and excercise (still a lot to do)<br>
(I will write a full documented readme in the next days)<br>

## A4X
This is the assembly language used with avm_assembler, an example of a factorial expression can be found in src/factorial.a4x

## Compilation
I only use stdio string and stdlib so you just need to
<br>
## Compile
```
gcc main.c -o avm && gcc assembler/main.c -o avm_assembler
```
in order to compile both VM and Assembler
